Article: Species distribution modeling of two rare endemic Myrtaceae from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest: challenges in conserving “invisible species”
Authors: Ana Flávia Augustin, Duane Fernandes Lima, Fábio C. S. Vieira and Mayara Krasinski Caddah

## Repository content
- R scripts for data processing, PCA, and SDM (Maxent via flexsdm)  
- Raw occurrence data
- PCA results with coefficients, variance and PCs used
- Models (outputs) generated for each species under current and future scenarios (see description)   

## Reproducibility
Analyses were conducted in R 4.5.1 with the **flexsdm** package (v.1.3.6) and other supporting packages.  
Spatial adjustments and maps were prepared in QGIS 3.28.7.  

## Data availability
All analysis scripts are provided here in this repository, but if you have any questions, please contact afaugustin@gmail.com.
